1. Comparing to Insertion sort, it requires more or less time?
   - It requires less time. Insertion sort O(n^2) vs Merge sort O(n log n).
2. Comparing to Insertion sort, it requires more or less memory?
   - It requires more memory. Insertion sort O(1) vs Merge sort O(n)
3. Comparing to Insertion sort, how does it behave when an array is partially sorted?
   - Merge sort works the same as for not sorted array. Insertion sort works faster, because it doesn't go inside nested loop.
